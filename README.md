# DPDK-in-AWS

Description :
-------------------------------------------------------
Try dpdk applications from DPDK library in AWS EC2 instance and see what works what not.

In AWS there are two types of instances which supports DPDK under enahnced networking.DPDK application can be run in that. 

	1. Enhance Networking : ENA pmd
	2. Ehnahce Networking : Intel 82599 VF 

Will try both of these and add what addition work needed and exact steps needed for each type.

If any modification required to DPDK example applications to make it work , I  would add the code changes here just for easy reference. This doesn't mean that there is any issues with DPDK example applications.
